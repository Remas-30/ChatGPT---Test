# Galactic Expansion — How To Play
Welcome, Commander! Build your space economy, expand to star systems and galaxies, and reshape the universe.

## Basics
- Earn **Credits** passively.
- Buy **Generators** to increase your production.
- Convert progression into higher-tier resources (Alloys → Antimatter → Dark Matter → Cosmic Strings).
- The game progresses while idle, and also when you're offline.
- Need to adjust production? [Open Generators](app://open/generators)

## Generators
- Each generator produces a resource **per second**.
- Costs grow geometrically with level.
- Use multi-buy: **x1/x10/x100/Max** to scale purchases quickly.
- See **Upgrades** → [Open Upgrades](app://open/upgrades)

## Upgrades
- Upgrades multiply production for certain generators or resources.
- Some upgrades unlock new systems or efficiencies.
- Track new tech and reinvest often. [Visit Upgrades](app://open/upgrades)

## Prestige (Resets for Powerful Currencies)
- **Warp (Tier 1):** Reset star systems to earn **Warp Cores** for global multipliers.
- **Ascension (Tier 2):** Reset galaxies for **Ascension Shards** (meta upgrades).
- **Singularity (Tier 3):** Collapse for **Entropy**—late-game scaling and new caps.
- Ready to reset? **Prestige (Warp)** → [Open Prestige](app://open/prestige)

## Events
- Random space phenomena (e.g., **Comet Shower**, **Wormhole Surge**) grant temporary boosts.
- Watch the banner for timers and plan big purchases during boosts!

## Map
- Explore nodes (systems → sectors → galaxies) to unlock new generators and bonuses.
- Some nodes gate new tiers and mechanics—expand strategically.
- Plot your expansion: [Open Map](app://open/map)

## Offline Progress
- When you return, you'll gain resources based on your production while away.
- Tuned by **Offline Efficiency** and **Max Offline Hours**.

## Tips
- Push to unlock new generators and upgrades.
- Prestige when gains slow down to collect powerful currencies.
- Use **Max** buy to optimize time and minimize clicks.
- Stuck? Revisit [Help](app://open/help) for quick reminders.

## FAQ
**Q: Do I lose everything on prestige?**
A: You keep meta-currencies and unlocked meta-upgrades. Base progress resets.

**Q: Is there a pay-to-win?**
A: No. Cosmetics and convenience only (DLC-ready), balanced for fair play.

**Q: Will my save be safe on Steam?**
A: Local JSON saves now; Steam Cloud hooks are ready for later integration.
